This is an Ethereum based smart contract which uses Solidity language.
This is a simple lottery system in which :
  - an organizer deploys the contract and organizes a lottery 
  - the participants deposit one or more ethers to the contract and take part in the lottery
After all participants have deposited the ethers to the contract, the organizer may pick the winner. Only the organizer is allowed to do so.
The winner is picked randomly by using secure hash value.
After the winner is picked, the ethers are transferred to the winner's account.
At the end, the lottery is resetted, i.e. all the participants are removed from the list, and the lottery contract is ready to be used again, if required.
